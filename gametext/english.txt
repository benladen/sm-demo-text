Check out my Pokémon! It’s so cute!
No matter whether I win or lose, my Pokémon’s still\nthe cutest!
Time to go look for more cute Pokémon!\nThanks for playing with me!
Huh? Is it over already?!
Hmmph! I guess I just have to hold that loss.
Hey! Hey! You’ve got a Pokémon, so let’s have a\nPokémon battle!
I lost, but it was fun. Wait...\nShould I say it was fun, but I lost?
I’m going to make my Pokémon battle more,\nso it can grow stronger and stronger!
Let me show you the awesome combination\nthat is me and my Pokémon.
You and your Pokémon were a better combination...
I have to catch more Pokémon until I can create\nthe perfect combination.
I’ll never forget how strong you and your Pokémon were when\nbattling at full force.
